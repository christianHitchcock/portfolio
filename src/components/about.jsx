                    <p>following unsuccessful attempts to pursue computer science in university. I made the decision to give it another try and pursue my passion for technology.
                       I graduated with a good degree from the department of geography and environmental management. 
                        However, I continued to be interested in computer-related issues. During Covid I worked for a Wi-Fi company as an network operation intern. 
                       learned about the internet of things. fell in love with technology. I was able to restart my tech career because of my interest in IoT and smart devices.
                       I completed some iot classes on YouTube and reached the section where I had to figure out how to write with Python and the Raspberry Pi.
                       At that point, I made the decision to enroll in a boot camp and learn how to program.
                        without any prior programming experience, without any instructions or mentors. 
                        There was no one I could turn to for any useful information, so I made the biggest choice of my life.
                         I relocated to a new place and began my tech career.
                       I gained programming and website development skills using php, HTML, and CSS.
                       A few websites were developed before I finally learnt Python. developing more projects with Kivy and Tinkita.
                       Upon completing this boot camp. I volunteered to teach a few new students whilst learning a lot. I was still unsure about what to do next. 
                       I started looking for guidance from mentors and senior engineers when I was still locked in tutorial hell.  
                       I made the decision to study JavaScript after receiving instruction from a mentor. Obtaining a contract to create a website on the side
                        Without any prior understanding ofÂ WordPress, I built and developed this website.
                       I used my earnings from this employment to pay for a full stack development course by Angela Yu on Udemy. This course really opened my eyes.
                        This course improved my knowledge of JavaScript, node.js, react.js, databases, and other topics.
                       i started building more projects with MERN stack .  then  Focused my attention on frontend development and designs.
                        Built several projects from frontend mentor and still building.
                        Got a few friends from twitter and we started building projects together and communicating through WhatsApp and discord. 
                        This have given me better experiences and I have gotten better at programming. Studying and practicing everyday
                         I love creating and building stuffs.
                       Thanks for reading ðŸ˜Š</p>
